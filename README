cAGI was originally part of the WildPBX project. I've decided to release each component as a
separate project to encourage more rapid development by separating the pieces out. WildPBX,
instead of containing all of the libraries which make it up, and becoming a large monolithic
project, will instead become more flexible and modular as a result.

So I present to you, cAGI, the only fully compliant Asterisk 1.6 AGI library for C
developers.

This library is ready for production usage. I've been using it in production for over 5
months.
